I first learned about 3D printing at the Maker Faire in 2014, but I never got to actually see one working in person until 2016. I became *obsessed,* wanting to learn pretty much everything about 3D printing. I became obsessed and spent hours looking at videos, comparing models and learning all about it. I begged them all summer for one, having watched every single review video that I could possibly find to make the best choice.

Eventually, they budged, and 11 year old me got a $400 3D printer (which by 2017 standards, was *insanely* cheap). It didn't work very well, but I didn't mind; it was just more tinkering for me to do.

Around a year later, I saw that some people were building their own using 3D printed parts and other components they bought online. Something I thought would be really cool would be to build a *super* big one, so I ordered some miscellaneous parts online for around $100 and started printing parts to fit together. Unfortunately though, my parents didn't think it was very safe; I abandoned the project, letting the parts sit in my room for years.

In 2021, with all the free time from the pandemic, I decided to pick the project back up. During this time, I learned of the [VORON Legacy](https://vorondesign.com/voron_legacy) design by the VORON Design team and realized that I could reuse most of my old parts for it. I finished most of it between the months of May and July, but it had to be abandoned yet again; I was moving in December and it wouldn't fit through the door of the room I built it in.

Funny enough, when the time actually came, I didn't even need to disassemble it. Regardless, I had stopped working on it for so long I had lost all motivation.

In December of 2022 though, I decided enough was enough and I would finish this thing once and for all; it was finished in January of 2023, right before the development of Neutrino.
