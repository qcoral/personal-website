Right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I discovered the world of mechanical keyboards. I became pretty obsessed, even if I didn't know why (though in hindsight, I think it's because it was the perfect blend of art and STEM). I'm not really too big on it now, but the 2 years I had with it were invaluable to me; I did build services, programmed [custom firmware](https://github.com/qcoral/Arduino-KB-firmware-private), made digital renders, and designed custom boards as well. Pretty awesome.
